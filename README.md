# Todo
This is a Todo List website which is made with the help of Flask framework and Bootstrap

## Skills Learnt
In this project I learnt how to deploy a project on a hosting website like in my case I used Heroku and also I learnt How to use Git commands for version control and I also learned to use use Github Private repositories using SSL and making a SSL key for deploying the project files.

I used Flask Framework, Bootstrap, Heroku, Git and Github, SQLite Database, Jinja 2 Snippet, SQLite Viewer, Flask-SqlAlchemy and Template Inheritance.

In this Small Project I have applied the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation for managing the Todo list.
We can still add more things to this and make this much more effective but this I made for quick learning purpose right now.
